# EcoChain Carbon

## Project Description

**EcoChain Carbon** is a revolutionary blockchain-based carbon credit marketplace and environmental impact tracking system that transforms how we approach carbon offsetting and sustainability verification. Built on Ethereum, this comprehensive platform enables transparent carbon credit trading, rigorous project verification, and real-time environmental impact monitoring.

The system facilitates the entire carbon credit lifecycle - from environmental project registration and verification to credit generation, trading, and retirement. By leveraging blockchain technology, EcoChain Carbon ensures transparency, immutability, and trust in the carbon offset market, making it easier for individuals and organizations to make meaningful environmental contributions.
